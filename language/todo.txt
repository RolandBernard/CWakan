-> find most bugs...
-> better error messages
-> operation_euq for operation_t
-> operation_id for operation_t
-> allow copy for struct
-> extend to_str and write to function, def and struct
-> improve all *_id functions
 -> allow for double hashing (ie. changing the underlying prime)
 -> choosing more equally distributed hash functions
-> improve garbage collector
 -> loop detection
-> implement own allocator
 -> to improve speed on fixed size allocation (exp. object_t, operation_t, string_t...)

-> improve makefile
-> rewrite everything because it is just a big mess
